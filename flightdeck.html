								<h2>Flight Deck Display Systems</h2>

								<h3> Summary </h3>
								<p><p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>During a summer internship at the Boeing company in Seattle, Washington, I had the pleasure of working on the flight deck displays team for state of the art commercial aircraft. As a part of this team, I helped test computer interfaces in high tech flight simulators, prototyped interfaces for ergonomic testing, and conducted user research for new product lines.</p>

								<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
								<p><p style="text-align:justify">Touch screens are not a new technology, but they are new to the world of commercial aviation. That's because only the most reliable equipment can be approved for critical flight systems. Because of the rigorous testing required for new equipment in the cockpit, touch screens are only just entering this market. In order to keep up with the competition, it is imperative that companies like Boeing understand the needs of the pilots and the potential applications of this technology in context.</p>

								<h3>User Research</h3>
								<p><p style="text-align:justify">To understand how commercial pilots could use this technology to its fullest potential, I conducted one-on-one interviews with 12 pilots with commercial airline experience. Before the interviews, I spent time learning about the pilot's work flow from retired pilots in my work group. The interviews were semi-structured using an interview guide with suggested questions, however, my goal was to keep the dialog open and conversational. After the interviews, a more structured follow up survey was sent to each pilot to glean more quantitative information. After all the data was collected, the numeric data was consolidated using a coded spreadsheet and the qualitative data was sorted into functional categories.</p>

								<h3>Results</h3>
								<p><p style="text-align:justify">Using the data collected in the user research phase, I narrowed the focus of the new product line down to three features which would be most beneficial to the airline pilot work flow. As my final deliverable for the summer, I pitched these ideas to management and received approval.</p>

								<h3>Challenges</h3>
								<p><p style="text-align:justify">The biggest challenge of this project was finding active airline pilots to interview. Unfortunately, I was not permitted to interview pilots outside of The Boeing Company, so I compromised by interviewing retired airline pilots and test pilots working for the company.</p>
