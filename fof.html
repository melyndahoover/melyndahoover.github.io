						<h2>Factory of the Future</h2>
						<p>Augmented Reality is a powerful new technology with already proven advantages for manual assembly tasks. For this project, an AR app for the Microsoft HoloLens was developed and tested against alternative app designs on a mobile tablet.</p>

						<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
						<p style="text-align:justify">Augmented Reality interfaces are a relatively unstudied field of interaction design. Little research has been done to identify the best ways to design AR applications and the usability of these devices in specific contexts is still unknown. This work, commissioned by Boeing, sought to understand if and how AR technology can aid in a manufacturing setting.</p>

								<h3>App Development</h3>
								<p>During the course of this research, several different AR applications were built to provide mock aircraft wing assembly instructions. The two discusses here are a tablet based AR application and a Microsoft HoloLens application. The tablet application was used to test different interface elements to provide navigation cues to a user in a factory environment. The HoloLens application allows the user to operate hands-free and was tested for efficiency and accuracy in comparison to the tablet version.</p>

								<h3>A/B Testing</h3>
								<p style="text-align:justify">Data was collected through a user study featuring a between subjects design. Users performed three assembly tasks using one of the AR interface modes. Each mode featured different ways of presenting navigation information. Three different navigation methods were tested including using a 3D arrow to point towards the desired location, floating gates (like you might see in a video game), and a Point of Interest map. The tasks were accompanied by a demographic survey, a spatial thinking test and a qualitative post-questionnaire. Metrics like duration, and number of errors was also measured. The results showed that the 3D gates navigation method helped users perform the task more efficiently than the other methods.</p>

						<h3>HoloLens Usability Testing</h3>
						<p style="text-align:justify">Next we tested the effects of of using a head-mounted AR display on assembly speed and accuracy to determine if these devices are a viable option for delivering manufacturing instructions. Qualitative feedback regarding the overall user experience of the system were also recorded using a survey. 75 participants completed a mock wing assembly task using either the Microsoft HoloLens (n=35) or the AR tablet (n=40). A Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that participants completed the assembly faster when using the Microsoft HoloLens. However, some participants found the device uncomfortable to wear and thought it impeded their vision at times.</p>

						<h3>Results</h3>
						<p style="text-align:justify">At the end of this project, my team and I were able to recommend the Microsoft HoloLens as a viable product for delivering AR work instructions to manufacturing staff at Boeing. We were also able to outline key interface elements for this type of AR application as well as areas for future work.</p>

						<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
						<p style="text-align:justify">This research was challenging because of the lack of previous research on user interfaces in AR. The process of developing this application required a lot of iterative testing in order to create a viable product. I learned that testing early and often is essential to new product development.</p>
